## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries for responsive layouts

### What I learned

Working on this project helped reinforce the importance of starting with a **mobile-first approach** and progressively enhancing the layout for larger screens. I also gained more confidence combining **Flexbox and CSS Grid** in the same project to solve different layout problems effectively.

I learned how small layout shifts—such as staggered cards and offset rating sections—can significantly improve visual hierarchy and user experience on desktop screens.

Example of responsive layout handling using CSS Grid:

```css
.customer-review-section {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:
Improving accessibility (ARIA roles and better semantic structure)
Writing more scalable and reusable CSS
Exploring CSS utility patterns and modern layout techniques
Enhancing responsiveness for very large screens
